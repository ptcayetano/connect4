# connect4
Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. Connect Four is a strongly solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

The game was first sold under the famous Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974.

This is my implementation of Connect4 that consists of 2 players (human). The player 1 controls the blue token/chip while player 2 controls the orange.


Below are the libraries and technologies I used for Connect4.

NodeJS (https://nodejs.org)
is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework,[3] many of its basic modules are written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript. The runtime environment interprets JavaScript using Google's V8 JavaScript engine.

Jasmine (http://jasmine.github.io)
is an open source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.

Backbone JS (http://backbonejs.org)
is a JavaScript library with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the model–view–presenter (MVP) application design paradigm. Backbone is known for being lightweight, as its only hard dependency is on one JavaScript library, Underscore.js, plus jQuery for use of the full library. It is designed for developing single-page web applications, and for keeping various parts of web applications (e.g. multiple clients and the server) synchronized.

jQuery (http://jquery.com)
is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com)
is a free and open-source front-end web framework for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
